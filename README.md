# Regression_Analysis
The primary objective of this regression analysis was to construct robust 
predictive models capable of accurately estimating the relationship between the 
predictor variables and the target variable. Through a methodical exploration of 
the data, meticulous model development, thorough diagnostics, and rigorous 
validation procedures, our aim was to establish regression models that exhibit 
reliability and predictive power. By adhering to established methodologies and 
rigorously testing our models, we aimed to uncover meaningful insights and 
facilitate informed decision-making. Through this process, we sought to 
contribute valuable knowledge and understanding to the domain under study, 
ultimately driving toward actionable outcomes and improvements.
